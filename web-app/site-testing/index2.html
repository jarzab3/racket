    Dear Sir/Madam,
</p>
<p>
    I came across your advertisement and hence would like to take this opportunity to put forward my application for this designated role. I would like to
    briefly introduce my skills and expectations.
</p>
<p>
    I’m currently studying BSc in Computer Science at the Middlesex University, London and looking for a part-time job which suits best my skills in relevance
    with my course.
</p>
<p>
    Recently I used to work for few companies as it can be seen in my CV, the most relevant are: Operating of Assembly Machines and CNC Saw Machines in UK over
    the last few months. Moreover I got this jobs because of the capability to prove how I can apply what I have learned recently, in this particular case I
    meant that I have successfully completed and achieved a Certificate in Service and Programming of machine tools CNC. And without any experience
    successfully went through interview.
</p>
<p>
    However, I can find myself comfortable in most of cases. For instance, because of the rotating shifts in my previous company unfortunately I had to leave
    my job. And I found the job as a delivery driver and team member as well in local restaurant.
</p>
<p>
    Besides, I have an extensive experience under my wing in which I have relevant work experience; install software, configure and fix computers, computer
    networks CCTV system, and electronic appliances at commercial levels for a large warehouse and supermarkets.
</p>
<p>
    I am particularly good with people and always take the lead, whether it be an individual task or being a part of team. I am hard working, understand the
    value of time and am extremely patient and have a great presence of mind. I have an excellent ability to troubleshoot and solve problems and am also
    motivational, fast learner and work well under pressure.
</p>
<p>
    I am looking for opportunities which could reveal my best skills and help your company and myself as well. It would be a real privilege if I can have the
    opportunity to be a part of a team through your esteemed consultancy; and can assure you that my public relations skills combined with my working knowledge
    and work etiquette, surely will add on to the reputation of any establishment and will leave a mark on your company standards.
</p>
<p>
    I am available straight away and would be fine with any part-time shifts or contracts that come my way.
</p>
<p>
    Please find my CV attached herewith and feel free to get in touch with me, should you need any further information regarding my previous work or education.
</p>
<p>
    Hope to hear from you at your earliest convenience.
</p>
<p>
    Your Sincerely,
</p>
<p>
    Adam Jarzebak
